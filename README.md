# Factory-Layout-Optimization

## Introduction
This is a README file for the project "Factory-Layout-Optimization". This project involves importing and installing various required modules and libraries for the project.
The facility layout problem (FLP) deals with the physical arrangement of non-overlapping facilities in a particular area to reduce the total material handling cost. An optimum design layout of facilities improves the material handling efficiency as well as plays an important role that affecting the total performance of the manufacturing system like productivity, material flow, etc. Recent advances in the field of reinforcement learning have shown the capability of solving complex allocation facilities problems by considering material handling cost minimization factors while ignoring other factors related to the facilities' size, shape, and the flexibility of a user-defined number of facilities components. This project focuses on the creation of a custom environment and producing optimum layout design for unequal size facilities by using a reinforcement learning algorithm called Deep Q Learning with a varying number of functional units with the flow of materials and distance between the facilities taken into consideration as an optimum criterion. The algorithm produced an optimum design layout within 2.5 million steps of training by stable baselines library and 0.5 million steps of training by own design deep learning architecture and presented a promising capacity for solving complex facilities design layout problems for real-world applications in the future.
